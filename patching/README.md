# pydota2/patching
This folder is for automated tools to handle Dota2 Patches.

The script(s) will allow for automatic updating of docker 
containers for running Dota2 headless and dotaservice.

Additionally, the script will pull down necessary world-state
data and update all reference data/JSON files that are used
by the agents in understanding their environment.
